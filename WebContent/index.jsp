		<p>Hi guys, welcome to my website!</p>

		<p>Let me introduce myself first. My name is Ziyue Chen. I'm from China. I graduated from UCI this March and got my Master's Degree in Computer Engineering. Before that, I studied Microelectronics back in college. I'm really into coding. It is the passion of my life. I really think I can do something with it, something big and make a change. </p> 

		<p>This website is still in development. I'm currently planning on adding more stuff into it. But still, you can find a lot things about me. Check out the ABOUT section.</p>

		<p>Thanks for visiting. Hope you enjoy! :D</p>
