		<p class="textblock">I grew up in Shijiazhuang, a small city in northern China. It is a lovely city, especially in the winter, with all the willows and snow. I remember when I was little, I always ride my bike to explore the city, watching different people walking on the street and wondering what their stories are. </p>

		<p class="textblock">As a kid, I was really into comics and I drew a lot. My favorite type is adventure comics like Dragon Ball Z. So I drew a lot of stories about heroes taking on adventures seeking for tresures or saving the world. I really enjoy creating my own characters and telling stories. I guess it's becuase imagination is the most beautiful gift of a kid.</p>

		<p class="textblock">As I grew older, things became a little more realistic. I had to consider going to a good high school for college. The high school that I went to is actually one of the strictest schools in China. The most valuable thing in my high school is time. So we must get up in 5:30 in the morning and go to bed 10:10 at night. We have to stick to the schedule made by our teachers exactly and we barely have private time for ourselves. It was like hell most of the time but we did have fun at night, talking about everything and making jokes. That was the only relaxing moment of a day, which makes it so unforgettable.</p> 

		<p class="textblock">After three years of hard working, I finally had freedom and went to college. It is exactly how I imagined there: students reading books everywhere, trees line up prefectly with the lanes, swans swimming on a peaceful lake. It is so beautiful. </p>
